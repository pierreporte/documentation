Otter Browser Documentation
===========================

This is the source of the documentation for [Otter Browser](http://otter-browser.org). It is managed by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org). The theme used is the same as [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

All pages are simple reStructuredText files stored in the `/source` directory and its sub-directories.

To build the documentation, move to the root directory (it contains the makefile) and execute this command:

    make html

The files are generated into the `/build/html` directory.
