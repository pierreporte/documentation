# Otter Browser Documentation

This is the source of the documentation for [Otter Browser](http://otter-browser.org). [MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org) is used to manage the markdown source files ant to generate static HTML files.

For now, it uses the default theme (bootswatch).

To build the documentation, move to the root directory (it contains mkdocs.yml) and execute this command:

    mkdocs build --clean

The files are generated into the site directory.
