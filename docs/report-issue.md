# Bug Report and Feature Request

If you think that you found a bug in Otter or if you think that a feature is missing, follow this guide.

You must have a Github accound to report bug and request new features.

## You found a bug

1. The first thing to note precisely what the bug is and how to reproduce it. Be as precise as possible.
2. Then, go to [the bug tracker on Github](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues).
3. Search in existing issues (opened and closed ones) to see if someone else is having a close issue. If someone already reported something similar, you should write a comment if your situation differs (even slightly) to what is already reported. If nobody reported a similar issue, you should create a new one by explaining everything you noted in the first point.

## You want a new feature

1. Go to [the bug tracker on Github](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues) and search if a similar feature has been requested. Check open and closed issues.
2. If the feature has not been requested, open a new issue explaining your idea. Be as complete as possible (donâ€™t hesitate to show pictures).
