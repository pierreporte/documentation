:doc:`/advanced/index`
    For the features that are generally beyond browsing the web in a simple way.
:doc:`/customisation/index`
    For the customisation of the browser.
:doc:`Bugs and features </report-issue>`
    Procedure to follow when you encounter a bug or when you find that a feature is missing.
:doc:`/faq`
    Direct answers to common questions. These questions can usually be answered by fetching information in the documentation and tryouts.
