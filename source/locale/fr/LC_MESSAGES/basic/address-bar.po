"The address bar is the central feature of a web browser. Like every other"
" browser, you can enter any URL, with or without specifying the protocol."
" Pressing :kbd:`Enter` validates the entry. Besides, there are several "
"features worth of explaining in order to use them efficiently."

"The most simple form of completion provided is the text added right after"
" the typed text. To validade the proposition, simply press :kbd:`Enter`. "
"It is useful for frequently visited websites. For example, if you often "
"visit the Otter Browser website, you might want to enter `otter-"
"browser.org <http://otter-browser.org>`_. When typing the first \"o\", "
"the rest of the address is proposed: :samp:`o{tter-browser.org}`. "
"Entering more letters may correspond to new addresses. For example, if "
"you also visit `omg-otters-are-so-cute.com <http://otters-are-so-"
"cute.com>`_, typing the \"m\" after the \"o\" already entered, you will "
"be proposed :samp:`om{g-otters-are-so-cute.com}`. This completion feature"
" allows you to rapidly access you favourite sites just by entering one or"
" two letters."

"space, and eventually entering the query. For example, let's say you want"
