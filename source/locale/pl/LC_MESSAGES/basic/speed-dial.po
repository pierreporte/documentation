"The speed dial allows you to build a page containing links to your "
"favourite websites and a search field. It is generally used as `startup "
"page <startup-configuration>`_ or as default page in new tabs. These "
"links are simple bookmarks, but are stored in a specific folder. See the "
"`Bookmarks <bookmarks>`_ page."
