Bug report and feature request
==============================

If you think that you found a bug in Otter or if you think that a feature is wissing, follow this guide.

.. important ::
   You must have a `Github <https://github.com>`_ account to report bugs and request new features.

You found a bug
---------------

1. The first thing to do is to note precisely what the bug is and how to reproduce it. Be as precise as possible. Depending on the issue, you may need to precise the configuration of your computer (especially the operating system name and version).
2. Then, go to `the bug tracker on Github <https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues>`_. Search in existing issues (opened and closed ones) to see if someone else already reported something similar.
3. If so, you should write a comment that describes how your situation differ (even a slight difference matters.) Else, if nobody reported a similar issue, you should create a new one explaining everything you noted in the first point.

You want a new feature
----------------------

1. Make sure the feature you want does not already exist. If it not obviously lacks after some research in the programme, you can ask the community.
2. Go to `the bug tracker on Github <https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/issues>`_. Check open and closed issues to determine if the feature you want has been requested, accepted or refused.
3. If the feature has not been requested, open a new issue explaining your idea. Be as complete ase possible (don't hesitate to show pictures). If a similar feature has been requested, you can discuss and present how you imagine it.
